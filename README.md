# NANOPRE
## NANOPRE is a tool for preprocessing ONT-Nanopore RNA sequencing reads(before basecalling), it segmentates the adapter, polyA stall and the transcription from the raw signal.

## Installation
git clone https://github.com/haotianteng/Nanopre-release.git  
Install [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)  
Add Nanopre path into Python path: export PYTHONPATH=PATH_TO_NANOPRE  

## Code Example
Check out the sample code in the Jupyter Notebook Sample.ipynb for how to use the package.  

## Usage
### Inference
```python
python nanopre_eval.py -i INPUT_FAST5_FOLDER -o OUTPUT_FOLDER -m MODEL_FOLDER
```

### Label&Training
```python
python hand_label.py
```
Which give you a GUI to label the data.  
GUI operation:  
S - start  
X - skip the current read  
Q - quit and save  
R - enter into review mode, review the label result or running result by Nanopre  
    reverse the signal(if already in review mode)  

D - go to next signal in review mode  
left click - mark a segment  

Once you get enough labelled data, use nanopre_train.py to train.  

### Review
To review the segmentation result, run hand_label.py and enter in to the review mode, and choose the output folder to review the result.
